A watcher has visibility to an approval chain but does not have approval authority.
You can be added as a watcher to a requisition two ways:
1. A shopper or approver adds you to the approval chain as a watcher
2. You are in the requestorâ€™s approval chain and the amount of the requisition exceeds your band level authority.
